This application is designed to make it easier to rapidly enter special 
characters with a single hotkey.

HOW TO USE IT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Open the application and place the caret (text cursor) to the right of the 
character to which you want  to add an accent, then press F8 repeatedly to cycle 
through available accents for that character.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CHARACTER SETS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There are currently 2 sets of characters you can use. The first, named all, 
contains all the characters available through this program. The second, named 
limited (spanish, greek, danish), contains only  characters used in these 
alphabets (and the symbol transformations which are available to both sets). You 
can switch between the sets by selecting the tray icon and using the Character 
Set menu.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
GREEK CHARACTERS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Greek characters, these were added to help with mathematics rather than 
writing greek, as such there may be some missing characters from the every day 
alphabet. These characters are mapped based on their english name, for example 
if you are looking for the Sigma characater then you would use the S character 
for the uppercase version or s for the lowercase version.

SOURCE CODE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I made this for myself and a friends personal use, but on the off chance 
someone else gets ahold of this and would be interested in the source code then 
have a look at http://github.com/oscarduignan/ and see if I have stuck it on 
there yet (it will be the autoit application not the autohotkey one).

You will need to install autoit to be able to compile the source code into an .exe
file.
